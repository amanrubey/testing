fork the original repo
copy git url of forked repo
git clone <repo_url>
do some changes
git add . // moves my changes to staging area, ie we are telling what all to save
git commit -m "my changes" // saves my changes with the message
git push origin main // uploads my changes to github

now after some time, the original repo gets changed because of the obvious changes by other users.
time to fetch/sync

git remote add upstream <original-repo-url>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main // btw theres another method by clicking sync fork but we'll explore it later.
